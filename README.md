# Auto Charging System üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Techiees


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Nihal M - Collage of Engineering Munnar

### Project Description
Our project will help you to automatically turn on the switches whenever you plug in your charger. The main objective of our project is to ensure you never forget to turn on the switch when charging your phone.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Always forgot to turn on switch while charging mobile phone

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We added a infrared sensor in the switch board which sensor when the objects infront of it so that whever we plug in our charger it will detect and turn on the switch.
